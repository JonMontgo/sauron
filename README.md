# Sauron

[Sauron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron) has great psychic powers, including the ability to "see" at great distances.

Programmers like you and me tend to strain our eyes by spending hours at the computer trying to change the world :)

Such strain draws Sauron's attenton to you, and he reminds you to take a 20s break!

##What
Sauron reminds the user to take regular breaks and helps prevent [RSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) & [CVS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision_syndrome).
Since it  is nearly impossible for any computer users to remember that they have to take a break every 20 minutes, Sauron can help you in your mission.

##Why
Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is a temporary condition resulting from focusing the eyes on a computer display for protracted, uninterrupted periods of time. Some symptoms of CVS include headaches, blurred vision, neck pain, redness in the eyes, fatigue, eye strain, dry/ irritated eyes, double vision, vertigo/dizziness and difficulty refocusing the eyes.

Computer vision syndrome affects about 90% of the people who spend three hours or more a day at a computer.

## [20-20-20 Rule](http://visianinfo.com/the-20-20-20-rule-preventing-digital-eye-strain/)
To help you deal with this problem, the 20-20-20 rule suggests that after every 20 minutes, you should take a break for at least 20 seconds and look at objects that are 20 feet(6m) away.
